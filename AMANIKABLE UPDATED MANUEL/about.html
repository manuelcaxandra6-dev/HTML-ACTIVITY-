        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p> Amanikable comes from pre-colonial Filipino mythology and is known as a powerful god of the sea. He was once a god of hunters who granted strength and bravery, but folklore later described him as a fierce and ill-tempered sea god after his love for the mortal woman Maganda was rejected. </p>

        <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
        <p> Creating this digital story helped me understand how Filipino myths explain natural forces like the sea and storms. I realized that Amanikable represents both the danger and importance of the ocean to Filipinos. This project also helped me improve my skills in web design and CSS. It showed me that technology can be used to preserve and share our culture in a creative way.</p>
