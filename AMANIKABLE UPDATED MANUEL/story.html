        <h3>Beginning</h3>
        <p>
            Long ago, in the vast archipelago of the Philippines, the seas were ruled by
            Amanikable, the fearsome god of storms and waves. His wrath could sink ships in
            an instant, yet he also protected the islands from invaders. Among the coastal
            villages, sailors whispered tales of his fury, and children grew up in awe of
            his power. In one small fishing village lived Lino, a young fisherman who admired
            Amanikable from afar. Though he feared the god’s anger, he dreamed of navigating
            the seas with courage and honor.

        <h3>Middle</h3>
        <p>
            One morning, a merchant ship brimming with precious goods sailed recklessly into
            Amanikable’s domain, ignoring the villagers’ warnings. Enraged, the sea god summoned
            towering waves and violent winds that tossed the ship like a toy. Lino, watching
            from the shore, saw the sailors struggle, and one young man clung desperately to
            a floating chest of treasures. Without hesitation, Lino grabbed his small boat
            and rowed into the storm, determined to save the sailor. Waves crashed over him,
            lightning split the sky, and the winds threatened to overturn his boat, yet he
            pressed on. From the depths, Amanikable observed, curious about the boy who dared
            defy his power. Moved by such courage and compassion, Amanikable calmed the seas
            and guided them safely to shore.

        <p>
            When Lino returned, the villagers hailed him as a hero, yet he humbly credited
            Amanikable for sparing their lives. From that day, Amanikable punished arrogance
            but honored bravery and kindness. Lino continued to sail, teaching others that
            respect, courage, and compassion could turn even the fiercest storms into
            protection. The legend of Amanikable endured, a reminder that the mightiest waves
            could not overpower a noble heart.
